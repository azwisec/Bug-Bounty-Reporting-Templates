No Rate Limiting on Password Reset Link

Hi team,

I found there is no rate limiting on reset password link

Description:
Rate limiting is used to control the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network.
If the number of requests you make exceeds that limit, then an error will be triggered. 
The reasoning behind implementing rate limits is to allow for a better flow of data and to increase security by mitigating attacks such as DDoS.

Replication Steps:

Steps to perform this attack are:

1.Click on forgot password
2.Enter email and intercept that request.
3.Send to intruder and select ‘your email' parameter as a injection point!
4.Paste your email in the payload list 100 times.
5.Start attack and you will be receiving 100 emails

Kindly ask if you need more information or a video Poc

Impact:
This will lead to mass mailing to the targeted user, which will degrade the reputation of your company.

Thank You
