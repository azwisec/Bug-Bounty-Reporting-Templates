DMARC Policy Not Enabled.

What is DMARC?
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance) is an email validation 
system designed to protect your company’s email domain from being used for email spoofing,

Here as you can see, there is the line “Your email service provider is Proofpoint” , 
hence it is an email domain, and here as you can see “DMARC Policy Enabled” has a yellow tick, 
which means, DMARC Policy is there but has not been properly enabled (i.e. p=none), so still chances of spoof emails to come into the inbox.

POC:
1.Go to https://mxtoolbox.com/
2.Paste the westernunion.fr and check the dmarc result attached with attachements.

Attack Scenario:
Steps:
1.Go to www.anonymailer.net
2.In From Name write the name of target company.
3.In From E-mail, write an email from your target domain, for eg: privacy@website.com.
4.In To Email , write your email
5.Now send the mail, and if you get the given mail in your inbox then it will be proved that it 
is sending spoofed email directly to inbox, hence no spoofing protection on email domain.

Tip: In privacy policy of the website there is always an email which could be used if it is an email domain.

Impact:
The most simple impact is that if there is no spoofing protection on target website, 
attacker can impersonate as company and send emails to users from their email. 
Now this could lead to many bad things like account takeover, or in case of e-banking website, 
capturing funds of victims, etc like that, which will degrade the reputation of the company.
