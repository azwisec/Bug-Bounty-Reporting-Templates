No Rate Limiting on Password Reset Link

Hi team,

I found there is no rate limiting on reset password link

->Description of Rate Limit:
Rate limiting is used to control the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network.If the number of requests you make exceeds that limit, then an error will be triggered. The reasoning behind implementing rate limits is to allow for a better flow of data and to increase security by mitigating attacks such as DDoS.

->Replication Steps:
1.GO (Target URL) click on forgot password
2.Enter email and intercept that request.
3.Sent to intruder and select blank space as an injection point!
4.Set payload type NULL Payload and for testing purpose set number of payload 100
5.Start attack and you will be receiving 100 emails from (Target Domain).

Kindly ask if you need more information or a video Poc

->Impact:
->This will lead to mass mailing to the targeted user, which will degrade the reputation of your company.

Thank You
