Wordpress Vulnerability: XMLRPC Available to Users

Hello Team,

I found that (target URL) is vulnerable to XMLRPC API vulnerabilities.

->Description:
XML-RPC on WordPress is actually an API or “application program interface“. 
It gives developers who make mobile apps, desktop apps and other services the ability to talk to your WordPress site. 
The XML-RPC API that WordPress provides gives developers a way to write applications (for you) that can do many of the 
things that you can do when logged into WordPress via the web interface. 

These include:

Publish a post

Edit a post

Delete a post.

Upload a new file (e.g. an image for a post)

Get a list of comments

Edit comments

->Replication Steps:
Go to the (target URL) and in url add /xmlrpc.php.
You get 'XML-RPC server accepts post requests only', now proceed to next step.
Intercept this request.
Send to repeater.
Replace GET to POST.
Add the payload at the end of request.
system.listMethods


Press Go

You will get method list in response hence it is vulnerability.
->Impact:
There are many methods which should not be available to users and due to this vulnerability any person is able to access these methods. Some examples are, deleting posts, commentsand pages, getting user info, etc

Kindly tell me if you need more information

Thank You
