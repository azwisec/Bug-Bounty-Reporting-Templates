No Rate Limiting on Password Reset Link

Hi team,

I found there is no rate limiting on reset password link

Description :
Rate limiting is used to control the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network.
If the number of requests you make exceeds that limit, then an error will be triggered. 
The reasoning behind implementing rate limits is to allow for a better flow of data and to increase security by mitigating attacks such as DDoS.

Replication Steps:

Steps to perform this attack are:
1.Click on forgot password
2.Enter email and intercept that request.
3.Send to intruder and select 'q' parameter as a injection point!
4.Set payload type number and perform the below mentioned steps:

From: 6
To: 105

Step: 1
Hence you will have 100 payloads.

5.Start attack and you will be receiving 100 emails.

Kindly ask if you need more information or a video Poc

Impact:
This will lead to mass mailing to the targeted user, which will degrade the reputation of your company.

Thank You
